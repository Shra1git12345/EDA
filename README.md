Bank Accounts
A bank provides financial services/products, such as savings accounts, current accounts, debit cards, etc., to its customers. In order to increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts various marketing campaigns for its financial products, such as credit cards, term deposits, loans, etc. These campaigns are intended for the bankâ€™s existing customers. However, marketing campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank increases not only its overall revenue but also its total profit. You need to apply your EDA knowledge to the given data set to analyse the patterns and provide inferences/solutions for future marketing campaigns.

A case study on the Bank Marketing Campaign dataset. Though data cleaning is often done in a somewhat haphazard manner and it is difficult to define a single structured process, you will study data cleaning through the following steps:

Identifying the data types
Fixing the rows and columns
Imputing/removing missing values
Handling outliers
Standardising the values
Fixing invalid values
Filtering the data

A bank conducted a telemarketing campaign for one of its financial products called term deposits to help foster long-term relationships with the existing customers. The data set contains information about all the customers who were contacted during a particular year to open term deposit accounts with the bank.


What is a term deposit?

Term deposits or fixed deposits are the cash investments made for a specific time period ranging from 1 month to 5 years for predetermined fixed interest rates. The fixed interest rates offered for term deposits are higher than the regular interest rates for savings accounts. The customers receive the total amount (investment plus the interest) at the end of the maturity period. Also, the money can only be withdrawn at the end of the maturity period. Withdrawing money before the maturity period results in penalty charges, and the customers do not receive any interest returns.
